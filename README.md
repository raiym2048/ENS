## Getting Started: Usage Rules

Before using the application, follow these basic steps to ensure a smooth start:

### 1. Make sure required ports are free

Ensure that these ports are **not in use** by other apps on your system:

| Port  | Purpose              |
|-------|----------------------|
| 5432  | PostgreSQL database  |
| 8081  | Spring Boot backend  |
| 8025  | MailHog web UI       |
| 1025  | MailHog SMTP server  |

> You can check used ports with `lsof -i :PORT` or `netstat -an | grep PORT`.

---

### 2. Register at least 2 users

You need:
- **Sender** ‚Äî the one who schedules and sends notifications
- **Recipient** ‚Äî the one who receives them

Use Swagger UI to register users.
After registration and login, enter the received token into swagger - there is a column with a picture of the key where you can enter the token
